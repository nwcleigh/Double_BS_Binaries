We do not think that there is reason for confusion. we wrote: "...,
  but if the donor is an AGB star the enrichment will be mostly in
  s-process elements." For BSS 7782 we exclude this possibility, but
  for other twin blue stragglers we cannot disprove that the donor
  could be an AGB star. In those cases the enrichment of the blue
  stragglers will be different.  But since we do not discuss this any
  further in the paper, we have removed the "s-processed
  element" remark.

Yes, we corrected this.

Ok. At the end of the introduction, we added a remark to this extent.

>> SPZ/NL: This means feasible in terms of being able to reproduce the
   observed parameters of the system (or at least parameters
   consistent with the available observational data), such as
   sufficient mass accretion to drive both stars in the inner binary
   toward a mass ratio of unity. The most extreme mass ratio of 1.1+
   0.5Msun for the inner binary with an 1.4MSun donor could in
   principle lead to two 1.4MSun blue stragglers, but in that case
   mass transfer has to be conservative. In our simulations, only a
   fraction of the mass lost from the donor is accreted by the two
   companion stars. We cannot exclude the possibility that even mass
   that appears to be ejected from the system eventually falls
   back. However, our simulations did not last sufficiently long to
   validate this point. We prefer to remain somewhat conservative (no
   pun intended).

>> ** This question was not just for me, but also for the reader. I would suggest adding only the words in the first sentence of the above response.

Okay, we clarified this in the text..

>> "By the end of the simulations the spin of the primary is about
   50.5 rotations per day, and 41.5 rotations per day for the
   secondary star." - The authors might want to reference Leiner et
   al. 2018 for observational "confirmation" of these spin rates early
   in the lifetime of mass transfer products. Similarly, the current
   stars are not spinning this fast. Some explanation is merited.

>> SPZ/NL: We do not have sufficient space to elaborate on these
   points in great detail, but magnetic braking has been proposed to
   explain the spin- down of the accretors post-mass transfer, which
   could render their â€œfinalâ€ spin rates in better agreement with
   the observations. We have included a brief sentence to better
   explain this, and referenced Leiner et al. 2018 to support it.

>> ** I'm puzzled for I don't see this reference? If the authors
      decided not to use it, that is up to them, but the manuscript is
      not consistent with their response.

Hmm. this was an ommission on our side. We included it again.


>> The remaining two points of the current Section 5: Discussion are
>> mildly interesting, but could be removed if length is an issue.

>> ** Fine with me. I only note that the Letter is getting long.

Okay. We removed these points.


>> SPZ/NL: We have included a sentence here explaining how this relates directly to a prediction for a comparable final orbital period for the proposed outer tertiary. 


>> Broadly speaking, the abstract is rather unusual in that it is not at all an abstract of the paper but rather a restatement of the predictions in the current Summary. As I wrote above, it is very good that the authors are making explicit predictions. But an abstract is intended to permit a reader to be informed about the entire essential content of a paper, and as such this abstract does not seem appropriately constructed. 

We rewrote the abstract.
